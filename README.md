# Rustine

Rustine is a minimal engine I develop to train myself on the specificites of game engine programming in Rust.

For now, it simply implements [Learn Wgpu](https://sotrh.github.io/learn-wgpu/) but doesn't include the assets.
You can get them from the official website and includes them in `assets/images` for `happy-tree.png` and `assets/models/cubes` for the `cube` files.

You can run `cargo run --example learn_wgpu` to run Learn Wgpu tutorials implementation. Only the last exercise I've written is available.
